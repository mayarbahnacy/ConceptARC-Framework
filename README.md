# ConceptARC Framework

## Overview
The **ConceptARC Framework** is designed for solving problems from the **Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)**, a dataset that tests AI's ability to generalize and reason conceptually. The framework provides tools for analyzing and solving ARC tasks using various computational techniques, including functional programming, heuristic search, and deep learning approaches.

## Features
- **Dataset Handling**: Loads, preprocesses, and structures ARC tasks from training, evaluation, and test sets.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Examines ARC task patterns, structures, and transformations.
- **Model Development**: Implements heuristic-based and deep learning models using **PyTorch**.
- **Task Transformation & Search**: Uses combinatorial techniques to generate and evaluate possible solutions.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical insights into ARC problem structures.

## Requirements
To run this notebook, install the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib
- Any additional libraries used within the notebook

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas torch matplotlib
```

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the **ARC Kaggle** repository (as done in the notebook):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alejandrodemiquel/ARC_Kaggle
   cd ARC_Kaggle
   ```
2. Load the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run the cells sequentially to load data, preprocess it, and apply different solution methods.
4. Modify parameters, algorithms, or models to experiment with different approaches.

## Expected Output
- Processed ARC datasets for training, evaluation, and testing.
- Visualization of task transformations.
- AI/heuristic-based solutions for ARC tasks.
- Model performance metrics and evaluation.

## Applications
